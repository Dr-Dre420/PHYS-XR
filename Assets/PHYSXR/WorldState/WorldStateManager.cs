    // Namespace note: this is deliberately PHYSXR.WorldStateSystem, not
    // PHYSXR.WorldState (which the containing folder name would suggest by
    // the PHYSXR.PhysicalWorld/PHYSXR.Communication convention). A namespace
    // named PHYSXR.WorldState would share its simple name with the
    // PHYSXR.Core.Data.WorldState class, which breaks unqualified "WorldState"
    // usage project-wide (e.g. in IDecisionProvider.cs) with a "namespace
    // used like a type" compiler error - not just within this file. This
    // was discovered as a genuine compilation issue while wiring
    // RuleBasedDecisionProvider and fixed by renaming this namespace.
